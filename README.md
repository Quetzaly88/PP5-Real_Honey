FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION: Bulk product import via CSV
This feature can be implemented in the future to allow administrators to upload product details through a CSV file, reducing the time and effort required for manual data entry. For this we will need to immport csv. This won't be done in this project now because this project is in a small scale, otherwise, it can be implemented in the future.
