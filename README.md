FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION: Bulk product import via CSV
This feature can be implemented in the future to allow administrators to upload product details through a CSV file, reducing the time and effort required for manual data entry. For this we will need to immport csv. This won't be done in this project now because this project is in a small scale, otherwise, it can be implemented in the future.

Future implementation product size:
Currently, the product size options are defined as a set of predefined choices in the SIZE_CHOICES tuple. This approach ensures consistency and simplifies management for standard product sizes like 450g and 600g. However, it may require code updates every time a new size (e.g., 50g or 700g) needs to be added.
